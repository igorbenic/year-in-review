# Year in Review

This is a simple project to easily list as many year in review articles as possible. 

I love reading how everyone has experienced a year in more than perspectives (business, life, hobbies etc.).

# Add a Year in Review

To add a year in review, you can either create an issue here: [https://github.com/igorbenic/year-in-review/issues/new](https://github.com/igorbenic/year-in-review/issues/new) stating the following:

```

Author*:
URL*:
Thumb (url):
Categories
Year*
```

Or fork this repository, add your own into `public/reviews.json` and create a PR to add it here in the repository.

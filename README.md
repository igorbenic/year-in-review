# Year in Review

This is a simple project to easily list as many year in review articles as possible. 

I love reading how everyone has experienced a year in more than perspectives (business, life, hobbies etc.).

# Add a Year in Review

To add a year in review, you can either create an issue here: [https://github.com/igorbenic/year-in-review/issues/new])https://github.com/igorbenic/year-in-review/issues/new) stating the following:

```
Title*:
Author*:
URL*:
Thumb (url):
Categories
Year*
```

Or fork this repository, add your own into `src/reviews.js` and create a PR to add it here in the repository.

Current process is using the data as an object so for each change I have to redeploy it. I'll work on it so it can fetch data from a remote json so we don't have to redeploy the site just to fetch new data.
